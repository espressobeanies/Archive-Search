# Archive-Search

Archive search is a recreated search script I developed at my last role. It in no way the original and when completed, it'll be significantly enhanced from the original. The script works by providing an intuitive text-based menu to search for archived information of compressed log files in ways that would otherwise take a very long time.

Several cool features I learned about bash scripting from originally developing this script is that it uses C-style "for" loops and multi-threading for high-performance acceleration can be achieved by backgrounding nested commands generated from these "for" loops.

A limitation to using bash functions can be summarized by the word "variable passthrough". C and Python do this better, so the final output will incorporate Python snippets.

Please note, the script is a work-in-progress and has not been vetted for errors yet.
